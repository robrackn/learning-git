# I'm learning git

*Alert: This is of no practical value to anyone other than myself.*

## Lesson 1: Cloning the repository onto the Raspberry Pi 
*This assumes you've created your repository on github.*

`git clone` will clone the repository currently on the github server onto the RaspBerry pi.
For simplicity, we'll assume it's the master branch.

## Lesson 2: Create a new document for the repository on the RasPi
*This assumes you know how to use vim to create a document and save it.*

1. You must `git add document_name` the document so github knows about it.
2. Then you `git commit`
3. Finally `git push` the document up to github.
